so the first thing i did was to create the game alorgithm in javascript
 and test

made the three game variables set two inputs from user and computer 
randomise the computers own then set conditions for the winner easy

e dan tey since is use javascript me sef dey try okay it simliar to pytthon and others
 the only stress here is just that you have to set combination for every possible combinations


 now with that set lets input variables and try them out lets manuals aet values for them

 fine alorgithm works fine

 i figured out javascript uses a method random can couldn't do taht with strings so i had to use arrays 

 now i had to do the indivual pages for jquery to work and do some shitty css smh ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
 the first i did was the home page to start the game i might add a background animation tho 
 okay i have made the first page time to make it dynamic man i have to read jquery again smh

 so i face an issues with cors request and now the whole page might have to be complicated asf

 okay i found a way but i have to sacrifice the index page now i need the page to interact with the alorgithm

 okay to be honest frontend get to much stress imma stick to adobe xd

 okay cool i was able do buld a simple ui for the game now to make it interactive

 i'm done just to add some cool features fun fact the backend for the game i just wrote it i didnt debug tested it and it worked fine 
 but nah frontend ehn nah stress

 i'm adding some cool animation

 well i'm too tired to work on animation timing so lets leave it there
